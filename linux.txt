If you want to compress several files into one file in linux, 
You have to create a file archive first by combining several files you want to compress into a single file 

Compression in Linux consists of collection and compression separately

command : tar [option] [archive_file`name.tar] [bundled file/directory] (archive produce: tape archive)
option -c : create archive file
       -t : Without dismantling the archive file, print the content in the monitor
       -x : Decompose the archive file and extract the bundled file
       -f : appoint file`name
       -v : print the process of creating or releasing archive files
       -u : update
       -r : add new file in the existing archive file 
       -z : gzip
       -j : bzip2

case 1 (create archive file) : -cvf option
case 2 (decompose archive file) : -xvf option
case 3 (print the content in the compressed archive file) : -tvf option

command : gzip [file`name to compress] (Linux standard compression utility that compresses file size to save disk space or reduce data transfer speed)
option -d : decompose compression
       -v : print the process of executing the compression
       -l : print the information of compressed file


command : gunzip [file`name to decompose] (Decompose compressed file in the gzip)

command : bzip2 [file`name to compress] (bzip2 has a higher compression rate than gzip,but the speed is lower than gzip) 
option -d : decompose compression 
       -v : print the process of executing the compression 

command : bunzip2 [file`name to decompose] (Decompose compressed file in the gzip)

----<print>---- 

command : cat [text file`name] (print the content of text file on the standard output device)

       -B number (print the number of top lines specified, including the search string '
       -c : print the number of line included the search string 
       -i : Not divide in upper,lower case
       -n : print the line number in the search results

command : find [start path] [option] [search target] [action]
option -maxdepth [number] : 시작경로를 기준으로 몇 단계의 하위 디렉터리까지 검색할 지를 지정한다.  
       -name [filename] : 
       -size [filesize] :
       -user [USER] :  
       -group [GROUP] : 
       -type [file form] : 

action -print :
       -fprint [filename]: 검색한 결과를 지정한 파일로 저장(단: 이름이 같은 파일이 이미 존재할 경우 덮어쓰기를 수행)
       -exec [명령어] {}\n; : 검색 결과에 대해 수행할 명령을 지정 

ex) find /dev -maxdepth 2 -name *sd* -print , find /dev -size +3k -print
    find / -user jinil -print , find ./ -type l -print , find ./ -size +500k -fprint result
    find ./ -name test* -exec rm{}\;
